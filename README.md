# Diproche-Webinterface

## Developing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before running the project for the first time, run `npm install` in the project folder. This needs to be repeated whenever the dependencies of the project change.

To run the project, run `npm run start` in the project folder. This will watch all project files for changes and re-compile and restart the application automatically.

`npm run test` can be used to start a watcher that runs all tests in the project folder.

## Deploying

Running `npm run build` will turn all sources into plain html+css+javascript that can be hosted by any http-server.
